Qt AT-SPI2 bridge
=================

This is a Qt plugin that bridges Qt's accessibility API to AT-SPI2.
With recent versions of AT-SPI2 this should make Qt applications accessible
with the help of tools such as Gnome's Orca screen-reader.

Qt will only load this plugin when the environment variable
QT_ACCESSIBILITY is set to 1.

$ export QT_ACCESSIBILITY=1
