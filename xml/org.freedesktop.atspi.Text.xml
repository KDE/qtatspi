  <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>The text interface should be implemented by objects which place textual information onscreen as character
      strings or glyphs.  The text interface allows access to textual content, including display attributes and
      semantic hints associated with runs of text, and access to bounding box information for glyphs and substrings.
      It also allows portions of textual content to be selected, if the object's StateSet includes
      STATE_SELECTABLE_TEXT.   </p>

    <p>In some cases a Text object may have, as its content, an empty string.  In particular this can
      occur in the case of Hypertext objects which do not display explicitly textual information onscreen,
      as Hypertext is derived from the Text interface, see Hypertext.  </p>

    <p>Typographic and semantic attributes of onscreen textual content, for instance typeface, weight, 
      language, and such qualities as 'emphasis' or 'blockquote', are represented as text attributes.
      Contiguous sequences of characters over which these attributes are unchanged are referred to as
      'attribute runs', and are available via Text.getAttributeRun.  Where possible, implementing clients
      will report textual attributes which are the same over the entire text object, for instance those
      inherited from a default or document-scope style, via getDefaultAttributes instead of reporting them
      explicitly for each character.  Therefore, for any span of text, the attributes in effect are the union
      of the set returned by Text.getDefaultAttributes, and the set returned at a particular character
      offset via Text.getAttributeRun.  </p>

    <p>Events that may be emitted by instances of Text include:
	    <ol>
		    <li>'object:text-attributes-changed' The attributes of a range of text, or the range 
			    over which attributes apply, has changed.</li>
		    <li>'object:text-changed' The text content of this object has changed.</li>
		    <li>'object:text-bounds-changed' The character bounds of a text object have changed,
			    for instance in response to a reformatting or reflow operation.</li>
		    <li>'object:text-caret-moved' The character offset of the text caret 
			    (visible or notional) within this object has changed.  Events of this
			    type may also be generated when an onscreen text caret appears or disappears.</li>
		    <li>'object:text-selection-changed' The range or number of text selections within
			    this text object has changed.</li>
	    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>In some cases, objects which are not onscreen may implement Text, but if such objects
      implement Component, their potential visibility should be examined (via comparison with STATE_VISIBLE 
      and STATE_SHOWING) before exposing them to the user.  Objects which implement Text but not Component 
      may be encountered in special-purpose interfaces or as special 'accessibility' extensions to visual 
      interfaces to allow non-graphical access to application features.  These instances should be considered 
      the exception, rather than the rule.</p>

  <method name="getAttributeRun">
    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Query a particular text object for the text attributes defined at a given offset, 
        obtaining the start and end of the "attribute run" over which these attributes are currently 
        invariant.  Text attributes are those presentational, typographic, or semantic attributes or 
        qualitites which apply to a range of text specifyable by starting and ending offsets.  
        Attributes relevant to localization should be provided in 
        accordance with the w3c "Internationalization and Localization Markup Requirements", 
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-itsreq-20051122/
        Other text attributes should choose their names and value semantics in accordance with relevant
        standards such as CSS level 2 (http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512), 
        XHTML 1.0 (http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xhtml1-20020801), and
        WICD (http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-WICD-20051121/).  Those attributes from the aforementioned
        specifications and recommendations which do not concern typographic, presentational, or 
        semantic aspects of text should be exposed via the more general Accessible::getAttributes() API
        (if at all).</p>

      <p>For example, CSS attributes which should be exposed on text (either as default attributes, or 
        as explicitly-set attributes when non-default values are specified in the content view) include
        the Font attributes (i.e. "css2:font-weight", "css2:font-style"), 
        the "css2:color" and "css2:background-color" attributes, and "css2:text-decoration" attribute.     </p>

      <p>If includeDefaults is <code>True</code>, then this AttributeSet should include the default
        attributes as well as those which are explicitly assigned to the attribute run in question.
        startOffset and endOffset will be back-filled to indicate the start and end of the attribute run
        which contains 'offset' - an attribute run is a contiguous section of text whose attributes are
        homogeneous.   </p>

      <p>Clients seeking annotations or properties of a more general nature, which 
        are not specific to the onscreen textual content of objects and cannot logically be applied
        to specific character offset ranges,
        should use Accessible.getAttributes instead.
        The attributes returned by Text.getAttributeRun (with or without 'default attributes'), 
        are distinct from the properties/attributes returned by Accessible.getAttributes.    </p>
